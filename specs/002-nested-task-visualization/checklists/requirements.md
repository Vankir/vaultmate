# Specification Quality Checklist: Nested Task Visualization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- All items passed validation on the first pass; no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed —
  the user's feature description already scoped the feature (file-grouped view only for this
  iteration), and remaining ambiguities (indent normalization, action-cascading, deep-nesting
  screen limits) had reasonable, low-risk defaults documented in the Assumptions section.
